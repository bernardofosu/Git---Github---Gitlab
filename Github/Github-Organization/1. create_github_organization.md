# 🐙 GitHub Organization (Free Plan – Learning Setup)

## 🔹 What is an Organization?

- A shared account that owns repos (not tied to a single person).
- Members are grouped into teams with roles (RBAC).
- Controls: security, policies, secrets, billing, audit logs.
- Perfect for companies, schools, training academies, open-source groups.

## 🔹 Real Example: NakodTech DevSecOps Academy

👥 **People (30)**
- 20 Developers
- 5 Reviewers (QA/SME)
- 5 Platform/Admins (DevOps/Instructors)

👥 **Teams & Roles**
- developers → ✍️ Write on app repos
- reviewers → 🏷️ Triage (manage issues/PRs, no push)
- platform-admins → 🛠️ Admin (all repos)
- readers → 👀 Read (students/auditors)

📂 **Repos**
- web-app (frontend)
- api-service (backend)
- infra-iac (Terraform/Ansible)
- shared-libs (common code)
- course-materials (docs/examples)

📊 **Access Matrix**
- web-app, api-service, shared-libs: dev=Write, reviewers=Triage, admins=Admin, readers=Read
- infra-iac: dev=Read, reviewers=Triage, admins=Admin
- course-materials: dev=Write, reviewers=Triage, admins=Admin, readers=Read

## 🔹 Quick Role Cheat-Sheet
- 👀 **Read** → view code/issues/PRs
